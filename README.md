# bilav-website-sample
Home page of the 'Bilav Information Services LLP' website

Page has been made using basic HTML, CSS & JavaScript
No extra JavaScript libraries have been used

However, the entire website could be made dynamic using React/Angular

### TO-DO
1. Find a better alternative for the animation code in the HTML
   * The current code adds multiple lines of redundant HTML code
   * A CodePen animation has been used the link to which is in the comments of the CSS files
   * Find an alternative which looks the same but does not have as many lines of repeating code

2. Incorporate React
   * Convert the current page into a react componenet
   * Create the remaining pages add routes to each page

3. Rectify latest login time on home page
   * The element only displays the current time using a JavaScript function
   * The time changes every time the page is refreshed
   * Change it to display the time the user logged into the page
